/**
 * Public global facade for the discovery standard.
 *
 * This file is required eagerly (not via the namespaced autoloader) so the
 * `Heera_Agent_Discovery` class name is available to third-party plugins regardless of
 * load order. It is a thin, dependency-free queue: calls made before the
 * registry has run are buffered and drained during collection, so authors can
 * register from anywhere without worrying about timing.
 *
 * Authors have two equivalent options:
 *
 *   // 1. The action hook — zero hard dependency, no guard needed. If no
 *   //    WP_Discovery engine is active the action simply never fires.
 *   add_action( 'wpdiscovery_register', function ( $registry ) {
 *       $registry->register( [ 'id' => 'acme', 'title' => 'Acme', 'type' => 'commerce' ] );
 *   } );
 *
 *   // 2. The facade — guard with class_exists() since the call is direct.
 *   if ( class_exists( 'Heera_Agent_Discovery' ) ) {
 *       Heera_Agent_Discovery::register( [ 'id' => 'acme', 'title' => 'Acme', 'type' => 'commerce' ] );
 *   }
